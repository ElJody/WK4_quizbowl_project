# Quiz Bowl - J. Sheffield
# Wk4 Weekend Project Using Advanced API's
* A rudimentary CLi quiz game for all ages.
* If this first time a user has played they will need to register.
* After logging in the user can take a quiz and be scored using 10 randomly selected quiz questions from the bookstore API we had used previously in the week. 

* If the user is an "admin" they will have the ability to edit, create, or delete questions that belong to them. 

* If user is not an admin they will have "guest" privileges to simply take the quiz or quit.
